# Skydive

Skydive is an open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer.
It aims to provide a comprehensive way of understanding what is happening in
the network infrastructure.

Skydive agents collect topology informations and flows and forward them to a
central agent for further analysis. All the informations are stored in an
Elasticsearch database.

Skydive is SDN-agnostic but provides SDN drivers in order to enhance the
topology and flows informations.
