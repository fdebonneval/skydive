# Skydive

Skydive is an open source real-time network topology and protocols analyzer. It aims to provide a comprehensive way of what is happening in the network infrastrure.

Skydive agents collect topology informations and flows and forward them to a central agent for further analysis. All the informations a stored in an Elasticsearch database.

Skydive is SDN-agnostic but provides SDN drivers in order to enhance the topology and flows informations. Currently only the Neutron driver is provided but more drivers will come soon.

## Topology Probes

Topology probes currently implemented:

* OVSDB
* NetLINK
* NetNS
* Ethtool

## Flow Probes

Flow probes currenlty implemented:

* sFlow

# Dependencies

* Elasticsearch

## Install

Make sure you have a working Go environment. [See the install instructions](http://golang.org/doc/install.html).

Then make sure you have Godep installed. [See the install instructions](https://github.com/tools/godep).

```console
$ go get github.com/redhat-cip/skydive/cmd/skydive_agent
$ go get github.com/redhat-cip/skydive/cmd/skydive_analyzer
```

## Getting started

Skydive relies on two main components:

* skydive_agent, has to be started on each node where the topology and flows informations will be captured
* skydive_analyzer, the node collecting data captured by the agents

### Configuration

A default configuration is present under etc/. For a single node setup only the analyzer and agent port need probably to be changed. For a multiple node setup the analyzer IP/PORT needs to be adapted.

```shell
[cache]
# expiration time in second
expire = 300

# cleanup interval in second
cleanup = 30

[openstack]
auth_url = http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:5000/v2.0
username = admin
password = password123
tenant_name = admin
region_name = RegionOne

[analyzer]
listen = 8082

[agent]
listen = 8081
analyzers = 127.0.0.1:8082

[storage]
elasticsearch = 127.0.0.1:9200
```
### Start

```console
$ skydive_agent -conf etc/skydive.ini
```
```console
$ skydive_analyzer -conf etc/skydive.ini
```
